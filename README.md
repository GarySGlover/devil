Devil Mode
==========

Devil mode trades your comma key in exchange for a modifier-free
editing experience! Yes, the comma key! The key you would normally
wield for punctuation in nearly every corner of text. Yes, this is
twisted! It would not be called the Devil otherwise, would it? If it
were any more rational, we might call it something divine, like, uh,
the God mode? But alas, there is nothing divine to be found here.
Welcome, instead, to the realm of the Devil! You will be granted the
occasional use of the comma key for punctuation, but only if you can
charm the Devil! But beware, for in this sinister domain, you must
relinquish your comma key and embrace an editing experience that
whispers wicked secrets into your fingertips!

Read the [manual](./MANUAL.org) for more details on how to use Devil.
