** 0.4.0 (UNRELEASED)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 0.4.0
:END:

*** Added

- Add customisable variable =devil-all-keys-repeatable=.

*** Changed

- When a Devil key sequence translates to an Emacs key sequence with
  both the control key and an uppercase letter, the uppercase letter
  is further translated to its shifted form, e.g., =C-M-V= is
  translated to =C-M-S-v=.

*** Fixed

- Fix key translation when the Devil key is a key vector, e.g., =(kbd
  "<left>")=


** 0.3.0 (2023-05-11)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 0.3.0
:END:

*** Added

- Add customisation group =devil=.

*** Changed

- Move tests out to a separate file.

*** Fixed

- Fix spacing in documentation strings.
- Remove =devil-version= and =devil-show-version=.


** 0.2.0 (2023-05-09)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 0.2.0
:END:

*** Added

- Add =, k= to the default list of repeatable keys.
- Add =, /= to the default list of repeatable keys.
- Add =, m m y= to the default list of repeatable keys.
- Add command =devil-show-version= to display Devil version.

*** Changed

- Automatically detect the activation key and accumulate it in order to
  support =devil-mode-map= with multiple activation keys.

*** Fixed

- Remove a stray =message= call.
- Make the function =dev--tests= non-interactive.
- Translation issue that caused invalid Emacs key sequences on mapping
  =-=. For example, mapping =-= to =C-x= and typing =- C-f= produced
  =C-x CC-xf=.  This has been fixed so that =- C-f= is now translated
  to =C-x C-f=.
